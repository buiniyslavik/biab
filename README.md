# biab
My graduation project. BIAB stands for "Bank In A Box". It's pretty much an online banking system with the following options:
- Opening checking accounts;
- Adding payment cards to the checking accounts;
- Pay with issued cards (public key crypto is used to authorize payments);
- Take out loans;
- Pay for various services (made to be easily extendable).

The code is VERY quick-and-dirty, do not use it for anything except S&G.
