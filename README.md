# biab
My graduation project. BIAB stands for "Bank In A Box". It's pretty much an online banking system with the following options:
- Opening checking accounts;
- Adding payment cards to the checking accounts;
- Paying with the issued cards (public key crypto is used to authorize payments);
- Taking out loans;
- Paying for various services (made to be easy to extend).

Some parts were done in a hurry, so there's a lot of dirt in some places.
